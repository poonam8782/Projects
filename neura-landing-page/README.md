### Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure
1. **Create a new directory** for your project. You can name it something like `neura-landing-page`.
2. **Inside this directory**, create an `index.html` file where you will place the provided HTML code.
3. **Create a `styles.css` file** if you want to separate styles (though the provided code has inline styles).
4. **Create a `scripts.js` file** if you want to separate JavaScript (the provided code has inline scripts).

### Step 2: Copy the Provided HTML Code
Copy the entire HTML code you provided into the `index.html` file. 

### Step 3: Include Necessary Libraries
Ensure that you have internet access for the external libraries used in the HTML (like Tailwind CSS, GSAP, etc.), as they are linked via CDN.

### Step 4: Open the Project
You can open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the landing page.

### Step 5: Verify Functionality
Make sure all interactive elements (like the custom cursor, loader, and animations) work as expected.

### Example Directory Structure
```
neura-landing-page/
│
├── index.html
├── styles.css (optional)
└── scripts.js (optional)
```

### Next Steps
- **Testing**: Open the page in different browsers to ensure compatibility.
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying the landing page using platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for public access.

### Note
Since you requested to keep the design "same to same," no modifications will be made to the HTML structure or styles. If you need any additional features or changes later, feel free to ask!
